    "### What is an Independent Expenditure?\n",
    "According to the <a href='https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/making-disbursements-pac/independent-expenditures-nonconnected-pac/'> Federal Election Commission documentation</a>, an Independent Expenditure is an expenditure for a communication that 'expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified federal candidate; and is not coordinated with a candidate, candidateâ€™s committee, party committee or their agents.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Political action committees make independent expenditures to support or opposed candidates.  Independent expenditures are not contributions to a candidate and are therefore not subject to contribution limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis we are finding the similarity between candidates, based on those committees which spend money to support or oppose them.  "

    "## Calculating the Similarity Coefficient between candidates based on their shared contributors\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "In this notebook we calculate the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index> 'Jaccard Index', or Similarity Coefficient </a>, of candidates based on the identities of the committees who have spent money (independent expenditures) to support or oppose them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scores are between 0 and 100, with 100 being identical set of committee spenders and 0 being no shared spenders.  For example: two candidates have no similarity in terms of expenditures on them, they will have a Jaccard Index of 0.  Two candidates who have exactly the same committees spending money on them will have a Jaccard Index of 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful in understanding patterns of giving and opposition, and how political action committees might be exercising influence across multiple candidates and races.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method\n",
    "1. Obtain an RDD of the form (CandidateID, [list of contributor IDs])\n",
    "2. Cross join of the RDD generated in step 1 with itself\n",
    "3. Calculate the Jaccard Index of each set produced by the cross join\n",
    "    - get the sum of the length of the sets of contributors for each candidate being compared\n",
    "    - get the length of the union of the sets of contributors to each candidate\n",
    "    - divide the union of the sets by the total length of the sets\n",
    "    - multiple by 100\n",
    "4. Return an RDD of the form (Jaccard Index, (Candidate1ID, Candidate2ID))\n",
    "5. Print the return to the console\n",
